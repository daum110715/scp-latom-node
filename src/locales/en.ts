## 1. Overview

The Latom Node Documentation Terminal (Node LATOM-7) is a secure archival and retrieval system operated by the SCP Foundation. This terminal provides authorized personnel with access to SCP entries, Foundation documents, and operational tools.

> All access is logged. Unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Registration

To create a Foundation account:

- Click **Register** on the login page
- Choose a unique **work codename** (3-32 characters, letters, numbers, underscores)
- Set a secure **login key** (minimum 8 characters)
- Confirm your login key and submit

### 2.2 Authentication

Log in using your codename and login key. Your session will persist until you explicitly log out or your token expires. All actions are recorded under your personnel profile.

## 3. Navigation

The terminal interface consists of three main areas:

- **Header** — Search bar, language toggle (EN/CN), theme switch, and personal terminal
- **Sidebar** — Primary navigation links to all sections
- **Content Area** — Active page content with contextual controls

### 3.1 Available Sections

- **Dashboard** — Homepage with system statistics and recent entries
- **SCP Catalog** — Browse all documented anomalous objects and entities
- **Documents** — Foundation protocols, research papers, and incident reports
- **Proposals** — Submit and vote on operational proposals
- **Activity** — View your browsing history and bookmarked entries
- **About** — Foundation information and object classification reference

## 4. SCP Catalog

### 4.1 Browsing Entries

The catalog displays all indexed SCP entries. Each entry card shows:

- **SCP Number** — Unique identifier (e.g., SCP-173)
- **Object Class** — Containment classification (Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, Apollyon, Neutralized)
- **Name** — Designated name of the anomalous object

### 4.2 Filtering and Search

- Use the **search bar** to find entries by number or name
- Click **object class buttons** to filter by containment classification
- Switch between **EN** (English SCP Wiki) and **CN** (Chinese SCP Foundation) databases

### 4.3 Entry Details

Each entry page contains:

- **Special Containment Procedures** — Current containment requirements
- **Description** — Physical and behavioral characteristics
- **Addenda** — Supplementary research notes and incident logs

Use the **Bookmark** button to save entries to your personal collection.

## 5. Documents

Foundation documents are organized by type:

- **Protocol** — Standard operating procedures and containment guidelines
- **Research** — Scientific papers and experimental findings
- **Incident** — Breach reports and post-incident analyses
- **Directive** — Executive orders and policy changes

Each document has a **classification level** indicating its sensitivity:

- Unclassified — Publicly available information
- Restricted — Limited to assigned personnel
- Confidential — Requires need-to-know basis
- Secret — Senior staff only
- Top Secret — O5 Council authorization required

## 6. Proposals

### 6.1 Submitting Proposals

Personnel may submit operational proposals for Foundation review:

- Navigate to **Proposals** and click **Submit Proposal**
- Select a category: Protocol, Research, Containment, or General
- Provide a descriptive title (5-200 characters)
- Detail your proposal using the provided template
- Daily limit: 2 proposals per personnel

### 6.2 Voting

All personnel may vote on open proposals:

- **For** — Approve the proposal
- **Against** — Oppose the proposal
- **Abstain** — Decline to vote

Votes are **immutable** once cast. Proposals are reviewed by senior staff based on community input.

## 7. Activity

### 7.1 Browsing History

Your recent viewing history is automatically recorded. Use the **Clear All** option to reset your history. History is limited to 500 entries per personnel.

### 7.2 Bookmarks

Save SCP entries for quick reference:

- Click the **bookmark icon** on any entry page
- Access all bookmarks from the **Activity** section
- Remove bookmarks individually as needed

## 8. Personal Terminal

Access your terminal from the sidebar footer or header menu:

- **View** your codename, role, clearance level, and join date
- **Edit** your codename (must remain unique)
- **Change** your login key (requires current key verification)
- **Log out** to end your session

## 9. Search

The global search function (Ctrl+K or click the search icon) searches across:

- SCP entry numbers and names
- Document titles and content

Results are categorized by type (SCP or Document) for quick navigation.

## 10. Interface Controls

### 10.1 Theme

Toggle between **dark mode** and **light mode** using the sun/moon icon in the header. Your preference is saved locally.

### 10.2 Language

Switch between **English** and **Chinese** using the language toggle. All interface text and content labels update accordingly. Your language preference is persisted.

### 10.3 Sidebar

The sidebar can be **collapsed** using the arrow button at the bottom for a wider content area. Navigation remains accessible via the collapsed icon labels.

## 11. Security Notice

- Never share your login key with other personnel
- Report suspicious terminal activity to your site administrator
- All access attempts, including failed authentications, are logged
- Classified information must not be transmitted outside secure channels

## 12. Technical Support

For terminal malfunctions or access issues, contact your site IT department or submit a report through the Foundation's internal ticketing system.

      title: 'Anomalous Materials Handling',
      summary: 'Standard research procedures for handling and analyzing anomalous materials in laboratory settings.',
      content: `# Anomalous Materials Handling

## Safety Protocols

All personnel working with anomalous materials must adhere to the following safety protocols:

- Wear appropriate PPE at all times
- Never handle materials without Level 2+ clearance
- Report any unusual reactions immediately
- Follow decontamination procedures after each session

## Laboratory Procedures

### Preparation

Ensure all equipment is calibrated and sanitized. Verify containment field generators are operational before opening any sample containers.

### Analysis

Use only approved analytical instruments. Record all observations in real-time. Any deviation from expected behavior must be documented and reported to the supervising researcher.

### Storage

Anomalous materials must be returned to their designated containment units within 30 minutes of analysis completion. Never leave materials unattended outside containment.

      summary: 'Post-incident analysis of the containment breach at Site-19, Sector-4.',
      content: `# Site-19 Breach Report — Sector-4

## Incident Summary

On 2026-01-18 at approximately 03:47 UTC, a containment breach occurred in Sector-4 of Site-19. The breach involved SCP-████ and resulted in a temporary loss of containment for approximately 12 minutes.

## Timeline

- **03:47** — Automated alarms triggered in Sector-4
- **03:49** — Security teams dispatched to Sector-4
- **03:52** — Perimeter lockdown initiated
- **03:59** — SCP-████ re-contained by MTF Epsilon-11
- **04:01** — All-clear signal issued

## Root Cause

Investigation determined the breach was caused by a failure in the backup power system, which temporarily disrupted the containment field generators. The primary power system had been undergoing scheduled maintenance.

## Recommendations

- Upgrade backup power systems in all Keter-level containment sectors
- Implement redundant containment field generators
- Revise maintenance scheduling to ensure overlap coverage

## Classification: TOP SECRET — O5 EYES ONLY

## Preamble

This directive establishes the procedures and authorization chain for the activation of Protocol Zeta-9 in the event of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.

## Section 1: Activation Authority

Protocol Zeta-9 may only be activated by a unanimous vote of the O5 Council. No single member, regardless of circumstance, may authorize activation independently.

## Section 2: Activation Criteria

The following conditions must be met before activation:

- Confirmed XK-class scenario in progress
- All conventional containment measures exhausted
- Estimated time to total breach: less than 6 hours
- At least 3 O5 Council members available for vote

## Section 3: Execution

Upon activation, the following steps will be executed in sequence:

- Global amnestic distribution via Protocol ALPHA-13
- Activation of all Thaumiel-class assets
- Mobilization of all available Mobile Task Forces
- Implementation of narrative restructuring protocols

## Section 4: Post-Event

Following successful execution, all personnel involved will undergo Class-A amnestic treatment. This directive and all related documentation will be reclassified.
